# Licenses  
## Free Library License version 1  
It is a modified version of LGPLv3, which had its prime purpose in allowing static linking. It is also derived from GPLv3, as stated in the license, but is not compatible with it (since the clauses allowing it were removed). Since this is the first time ever it is used, it is obviously not approved by the FSF and OSI, but it definitely matches the criteria given by both of the organisations (in order to create it, Lno change was made such that it will make it non-free or closed-source license).
